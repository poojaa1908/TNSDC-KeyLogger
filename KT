Day 0 - HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

XN - it has a legacy app(seq and blocking flow) and migrating monolithic app to microservices arch

2 squad
1 - legacy app(connect with business) - adding new feature and plugins - get business details and new on boarding- new dev - db related changes and code level changes
2 - migration work 

Conversion services

Docs in form of zip, tart

Business rules + validation on that doc

To do the needed conversions and send to downstream

Whenever we see changes in agreed format - resend to upstream

Also dealing with print related operations 

ECR - no 

Nas and s3 based storage 
Sand based storage

Mq and kafka 

KT DAY 1

OneXN - legacy app

Confluence page - Process Config Inventory - contains all process and products

Process - list of action items on docs from upstream and pass to downstream - imp set of rules - (Input) Raw doc - (Output) Conv doc

So migration takes place process level 
Even legacy will contain that process as our expectation is to manage volume and be highly available

In legacy app, whenever we are onboarding any new process, reuse the already existing action classes

Control plane : 1XN dashboard for dev to get all action items info and more
Use QAEnt login

DB:
Imp tables - Process config - fetch id 
Then use in
