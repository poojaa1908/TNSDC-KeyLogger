Problem Statement 1: AI-Driven Test Plan Generation

Requirements are distributed across tools like Confluence, Jira, and Figma, requiring QA teams to manually consolidate information to create test plans. This process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to gaps in coverage, leading to delayed QA cycles and quality risks.

There is a need for an intelligent solution that can automatically interpret distributed requirement artifacts and generate structured, traceable test plans with minimal manual effort.

Problem Statement 2: Intelligent Email Digest & Smart Reply

High email volumes require manual triaging and repetitive responses, reducing productivity and increasing the risk of missed action items—especially after returning from leave or periods of high activity.

There is a need for a contextual email intelligence system that can generate concise digests, prioritize critical threads, extract action items, and suggest context-aware replies to accelerate inbox recovery and response efficiency.

Problem Statement 3: AI Meeting Summary & Insight Extraction

Teams spend significant time attending or replaying live and recorded meetings to capture decisions, risks, and action items, impacting execution speed.

There is a need for an AI-driven capability that can analyze live or recorded meeting content and automatically generate concise summaries, key insights, and actionable outcomes without requiring full manual review.

Problem Statement: Intelligent Tab Context & Reminder Assistant

Knowledge workers often keep multiple browser tabs open for extended periods without clear visibility into their original purpose or pending actions. Over time, this leads to forgotten tasks, missed follow-ups (e.g., awaiting query results, approvals, submissions), reduced productivity, and cognitive overload.

There is a need for a contextual browser assistant that can track the intent behind open tabs, detect pending actions or expected outcomes, and proactively send timely reminders or notifications when follow-ups are required or outputs are likely available
