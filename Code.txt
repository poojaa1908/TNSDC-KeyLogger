Just wanted to inform you that we’ve been facing some issues with the EVA report in Power BI. Recently, there’s been a noticeable increase in the number of users and conversations in EVA, and because of that, the report is hitting Power BI’s limitations and running into timeout issues.

To fix this, we’re thinking of showing only the last six months to one year of data in the report. We also plan to enable incremental refresh so that future refreshes are smoother and don’t fail.

As of now, all scheduled refreshes in the PROD workspace are failing due to this issue. So before making this change, we just wanted to check with you—are you okay with this approach?

Looking forward to your confirmation.
