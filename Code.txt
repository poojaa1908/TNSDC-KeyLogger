✅ 1. Azure Blob Storage (Recommended for Enterprise Use)

Steps:
	•	Create a Storage Account in Azure.
	•	Create a container (e.g., bot-assets).
	•	Upload your images.
	•	Set the container’s access level to “Blob (anonymous read access)”.
	•	Each image will now have a public URL like:
https://<your-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/bot-assets/thumbs-up.png

Pros:
	•	Reliable and scalable.
	•	Enterprise-grade (good for Copilot and MS stack).
	•	Can be secured or made public.

Cons:
	•	Requires Azure access and permissions.

⸻

✅ 2. GitHub (For lightweight use / static assets)

Steps:
	•	Create a public GitHub repository.
	•	Place all images in a folder (/assets).
	•	Access images using raw URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/assets/thumbs-up.png

Pros:
	•	Easy to manage and version.
	•	Free and widely accessible.

Cons:
	•	Rate limits apply.
	•	Not suitable for private/corporate environments without GitHub Enterprise.

✅ 3. SharePoint / OneDrive (Microsoft Ecosystem)

Steps:
	•	Upload images to a SharePoint Document Library.
	•	Set sharing settings to “Anyone with the link”.
	•	Get direct links for each image.

Pros:
	•	Works well in Microsoft environments.
	•	Simple for small teams.

Cons:
	•	Not a true static asset hosting service.
	•	URLs can expire depending on tenant settings.

✅ 4. Azure Static Web App or Azure CDN

Steps:
	•	Set up a static website using Azure Static Web Apps.
	•	Place your assets in the /images folder.
	•	Host with a custom domain or default Azure URL:
https://<your-app>.azurestaticapps.net/images/thumbs-up.png

Pros:
	•	Clean public URLs.
	•	Supports folders and web optimization.

Cons:
	•	Slightly more setup than Blob storage.
	•	Requires web app hosting knowledge.
