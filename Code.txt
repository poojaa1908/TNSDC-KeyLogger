This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the capability of Alteryx to facilitate data transfer from Microsoft Dataverse to an on-premises environment. The objective is to explore and validate how Alteryx can be leveraged to establish seamless connectivity with Dataverse using the available data source options, extract relevant data, and ship it securely and efficiently to an on-prem target system. This POC highlights one of the core integration features of Alteryx and serves as a foundation for potential production-level implementations involving hybrid data architectures.
