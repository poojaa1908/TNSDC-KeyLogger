✅ Handled Errors
	•	These are intentionally captured by the developer within custom topics.
	•	Handled using custom error-handling logic defined in the bot’s flow.
	•	Error details are stored using custom variables (developer-defined).
	•	Example: If a particular step fails in a custom topic, it’s captured and logged using predefined logic.

⚠️ Unhandled Errors
	•	These are not explicitly handled in the bot’s flow and are captured by the system topic called OnError.
	•	Triggered when no matching topic is found or an unexpected issue occurs.
	•	The error is logged under a common variable called ErrorTraceData.
	•	Reflects missing or incomplete handling logic in the bot’s design.
