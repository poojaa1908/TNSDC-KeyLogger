Analysis Document: Character Limit Testing in TeamChat via Copilot Studio Bot

Objective

To identify and validate the maximum character payload that TeamChat can handle when triggered through a Copilot Studio bot deployed in a Teams channel.

‚∏ª

Setup Overview

A chatbot was developed in Copilot Studio, and two topics were created with different payload sizes. The bot was deployed into a Microsoft Teams channel for testing.

Topics & Triggers:

Trigger Word	Payload Size (Characters)	Outcome
ACCEPT	40,767	‚úÖ Successfully displayed in Teams
REJECT	41,257	‚ùå Error displayed: ‚ÄúMessage size is very long‚Äù


‚∏ª

Testing and Observation
	‚Ä¢	When the ACCEPT keyword was triggered, a payload containing 40,767 characters was displayed successfully in the TeamChat interface.
	‚Ä¢	When the REJECT keyword was triggered, a payload containing 41,257 characters caused Teams to return an error message indicating the message is too large to display.

Screenshots of both outcomes have been captured and attached for evidence.

‚∏ª

Inference

Based on the observations, the maximum payload that TeamChat accepts without error lies between 40,767 and 41,257 characters.

To ensure stability and future-proofing, a 10% buffer was subtracted from the successful payload size to define a safe maximum character limit.

Calculation:

10% of 40,767 = 4,076.7
Safe Limit = 40,767 - 4,076.7 ‚âà 36,690.3
Rounded Safe Limit = 37,000 characters


‚∏ª

Conclusion
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ The TeamChat platform supports payloads up to 40,767 characters based on current testing.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Payloads exceeding 41,257 characters result in errors.
	‚Ä¢	üéØ A conservative character limit of 37,000 characters is recommended for production use to avoid runtime errors and provide a buffer for any backend or platform changes.
