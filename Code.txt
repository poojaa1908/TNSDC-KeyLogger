I would like to inform you that Thursday will be my last working day as part of my 6-month winter internship with Wells Fargo. This marks the conclusion of an incredible internship journey, during which I had the privilege of working with the iChat and ONIX teams.

It has truly been a pleasure working alongside all of you. Over the past months, I’ve had the opportunity to learn and explore a wide range of technologies and gain invaluable insights into the work we do here. I’m especially grateful for the support, collaboration, and encouragement I’ve received from everyone.

I’m thrilled to share that I’ll be rejoining Wells Fargo as a full-time employee starting August 25th, and I’m looking forward to continuing this journey with you all.

Please do share any feedback you may have regarding my performance during the internship—it would be immensely helpful as I transition into my full-time role.

Thank you once again for the wonderful experience.
