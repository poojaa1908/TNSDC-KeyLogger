Just to clarify — incremental refresh in Power BI doesn’t mean that the report will refresh multiple times per day. Instead, it means that only the new or updated data (for example, from the last few days) will be refreshed, rather than refreshing the entire dataset every time.

Right now, Power BI tries to reload all the EVA data each time it refreshes, which is causing the timeouts due to the large volume. With incremental refresh, Power BI will only fetch recent changes (like yesterday’s or today’s data), which is much faster and helps avoid those failures.

The number of refreshes per day will still depend on the schedule we set — like once a day or as needed — but each refresh will be lighter and more efficient.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you’d like me to explain further or if you’re okay with moving ahead with this plan.
