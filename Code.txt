I wanted to inform you that Thursday will be my last working day as part of my 6-month winter internship with Wells Fargo.

It has truly been a pleasure working with such a supportive and collaborative team. Over the past few months, I’ve learned a great deal and grown immensely, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this journey.

A special thanks to Shishir and Umesh for their constant guidance and support throughout the internship—it truly made a big difference. I’d also like to thank Santhosh and Abhishek for being incredibly helpful in all ways and for making day-to-day work so much smoother.

I’ve completed the knowledge transition for the work I was handling, so everything is in place on that front.

I’m excited to share that I’ll be rejoining Wells Fargo as a full-time employee starting August 25th, and I look forward to continuing this journey with you all.

Please feel free to share any feedback you might have—I’d really appreciate it as I transition into the next phase of my career.

Thank you once again for the incredible experience!
