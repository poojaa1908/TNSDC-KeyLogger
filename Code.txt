Title: Discussion on [BMCB-310] - Auto-Decommission of Prod Auto Chatbot

Attendees:
	•	iChat PE Platform Team: [You], Shishir, Umesh
	•	Platform Team: Austin
	•	Additional stakeholders: Production Support Team, Teams Admin Center Team (as needed)

Agenda:
We’re planning the decommissioning of the production Auto Chatbot shortly and would like to align on the following:
	1.	Overview of the current decommissioning plan
	2.	Review of attached documentation for disconnecting the agent from Teams (prod) and Microsoft Copilot Studio
	3.	Discuss options:
	•	Should the bot be deleted from the managed solution and backed up in GitHub?
	•	Or retained in the prod environment as an unmanaged solution?
	4.	Clarify best practices for bot decommissioning processes, applicable to future cases
	5.	Discuss iChat PE platform-specific considerations:
	•	Should topics (e.g., billing) be retained or deleted?
	•	Do we need a Change Request (CR)?
	6.	Identify high-level steps required for a smooth decommissioning

Attachments:
	•	Decommissioning Plan Document

Looking forward to aligning on the way forward.
