Certainly! Below are authoritative references from Alteryx’s official documentation and community resources that support the answers to your seven questions:

⸻

1) How does the scheduling work in Alteryx?
	•	Alteryx Designer Scheduler: You can schedule workflows directly from Alteryx Designer using the built-in scheduler. This allows you to set specific times and frequencies for workflow execution.
	•	Alteryx Server Scheduling: For enterprise-level scheduling, Alteryx Server provides a web-based interface (Gallery) where you can manage and schedule workflows. This includes setting up recurring schedules and managing them centrally.  ￼

⸻

2) We have multiple prod environments in Prod; do we need different jobs for Alteryx, or can we make it work with variables?
	•	Environment Parameters: Alteryx allows the use of environment parameters to manage different configurations across environments. These parameters can be defined and managed centrally, enabling workflows to adapt based on the environment they’re executed in.  ￼
	•	Parameterization Overview: Understanding how to implement parameterization in your workflows is crucial for managing multiple environments effectively.  ￼

3) Does deploying Alteryx workflows require a change request?
	•	Change Management Practices: In enterprise settings, deploying workflows typically involves a change management process to ensure proper governance and compliance. This includes version control, testing, and approval steps before deployment.

⸻

4) Does making changes to Alteryx deployed workflows require a change request?
	•	Workflow Migration Utility: Alteryx provides tools like the Workflow Migration Enterprise Utility to assist in migrating and managing workflows across environments, which is often part of a formal change management process.  ￼

⸻

5) Does making changes to scheduled jobs require a change request?
	•	Managing Schedules: Editing or deleting schedules in Alteryx Server is a controlled process, typically requiring appropriate permissions and, in many organizations, a formal change request to ensure traceability and compliance.

⸻

6) If the jobs fail, which support team helps us fix the issue?
	•	Diagnosing Failed Jobs: Alteryx provides guidelines for diagnosing failed jobs, which can be utilized by support teams to identify and resolve issues. The responsibility may fall on different teams depending on the nature of the failure (e.g., data issues, system errors).  ￼

⸻

7) What’s the process to get license and Alteryx installed on our systems?
	•	Installation and Activation: Detailed instructions for downloading, installing, and activating Alteryx products are available in the official documentation. This includes steps for both online and offline activation methods.  ￼
