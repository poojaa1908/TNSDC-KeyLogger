Implementation Plan for SSAT Normal Change Request (ServiceNow)

Change Title:
APIGE Code Fix and Service Account Addition for Dataverse API in Production Environments

Change Description:
Create an implementation plan to deploy the following updates:
	1.	Add Dataverse SPN to all Production environments.
	2.	Add Service Account for PowerBI reporting to all Production environments.
	3.	Apply APIGE code changes for dynamic environment logic updates.

⸻

Pre-Implementation Tasks:
	•	Review and validate the attached documentation:
	•	Sample CHG2955540 (Prod Update SPN.docx)
	•	Sample CHG2546562 (Implementation steps.docx)
	•	Coordinate with the APIGE team for dynamic environment code update readiness.
	•	Verify access permissions to the production environments listed.
	•	Notify impacted stakeholders regarding scheduled change timing.

⸻

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Dataverse SPN Addition:
	•	Access each environment listed below.
	•	Add the new Dataverse SPN as per the attached SPN update document (CHG2955540).
	•	Confirm SPN addition through environment-specific verification steps.
	2.	Service Account Addition for PowerBI Reporting:
	•	Implement service account updates following guidelines from CHG2546562.
	•	Validate successful account linkage by performing a connection test.
	3.	APIGE Code Fix Deployment:
	•	Collaborate with the APIGE team to apply dynamic environment code changes.
	•	Deploy the latest APIGE update scripts to each environment sequentially.
	•	Monitor for any deployment failures and perform rollbacks if necessary.
	4.	Environment Specific Scope:
	•	Strategy_Digital_And_Innovation_Strategic_Services_And_Advanced_PT1A-ICHT-prod1
	•	Strategy_Digital_And_Innovation_Strategic_Services_And_Advanced_PT1A-ICHT-prod2
	•	Strategy_Digital_And_Innovation_Strategic_Services_And_Advanced_PT1A-ICHT-prod3

⸻

Communication Plan:
	•	Notify impacted application owners before and after the change window.
	•	Real-time updates via Teams/Email communication during change execution.
	•	Send completion confirmation with environment health status post-implementation.

⸻

Attachments:
	•	SPN Update Sample Document
	•	Service Account Implementation Document
	•	Environment Scope and IDs
