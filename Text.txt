I’ve published the GPLVA Virtual Assistant bot’s report in the QA ENT environment (PTIA - TEST).

As discussed during our meeting, I’ve been able to model all the required details except for the User_Feedback section. To address this, I’ll need an array of responses with the scope field attached. This will help us distinguish between context-based responses and others.

I’ve also updated the error chart to reflect only the entries where isError is true and the unhandled errors. The chart now shows the summation of both categories.

Please review the report and share your feedback. Do suggest any changes required, especially in the JSON structure, and let me know once done.

Thank you!
