Slide Title: Implementation Plan – Dataverse Data Archival to On-Prem using Alteryx

⸻

1. Setup and Access Configuration
	•	Request a ServiceNow change request to allow a single SPN to access all 5 production environments.
	•	Justify the change: reduced complexity, centralized authentication, easier monitoring.

⸻

2. Data Extraction via Alteryx
	•	Use Alteryx input nodes to connect to all 5 Dataverse environments via the common SPN.
	•	Design Alteryx to fetch initial full-load data from each environment.
	•	Load this data into an Oracle DB (using different tables for each environment).
	•	Optionally, store data as Excel files for backups or snapshots.

⸻

3. Weekly Batch Job – Incremental Loading
	•	Use Alteryx scheduler or external cron job to trigger on Sundays.
	•	Extract only last 7 days of data.
	•	Append to respective Oracle DB tables.

⸻

4. Weekly Data Purging Job in Dataverse
	•	After extraction is confirmed, run a purging job.
	•	Ensure only last 30 days of data is retained in Dataverse.
	•	Delete earliest 7 days as new 7 days are added.

⸻

5. Parallel vs. Serial Execution
	•	✅ Parallel execution is feasible and optimal:
	•	Each input node connects to a different environment.
	•	Load data into different tables concurrently in Oracle DB.
	•	Alteryx supports multiple input/output streams in the same workflow.

⸻

6. Monitoring and Logging
	•	Log every batch run: number of rows extracted, timestamp, source environment.
	•	Add error handling in Alteryx for retries or alerts on failure.
