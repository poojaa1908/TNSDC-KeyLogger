Performed initial assessment and research for the auto bot decommission process. Attached the Confluence page documented by the platform team post our discussion, outlining the agreed decommission steps. Also attached a PDF detailing the specific steps to be followed during the decommission, along with the automation sponsor mail template received from the ASM team for reference.
