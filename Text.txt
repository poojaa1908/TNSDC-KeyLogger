Got it! Here’s the corrected version of Concern 3 for your report, now reflecting that the issue is with missing data due to logging failure, not a reporting mismatch:

Concern 3: Missing Data for User “Deb Erwin” in Reports

Observation:
The stakeholders observed that user Deb Erwin attempted to use the bot starting from June 2nd, but no corresponding data is visible in any part of the Power BI reports—neither in the Feedback report nor in the Adoption report.

Investigation Findings:
Upon checking the underlying data tables from June 1st onwards, there is no record of Deb Erwin’s interactions. A screenshot of the user logs confirms that their name does not appear in the dataset.

Root Cause:
The issue appears to be on the data logging side, not within Power BI. Since the data never reached the source tables, Power BI was not able to pick up or report it. This points to a potential failure in the bot’s telemetry or logging pipeline for that specific user or session.

Next Steps:
	•	Escalate the issue to the backend logging or telemetry team to verify why Deb Erwin’s interactions were not logged.
	•	Check if logging is failing under certain conditions (e.g., user-specific, authentication-related, or session timeout issues).
	•	Once logging is corrected, revalidate if future interactions from Deb Erwin appear as expected.

Let me know if you’d like me to integrate all three finalized concerns into a single polished report for submission or turn this into an email-style summary.
