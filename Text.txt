1) How does the scheduling work in Alteryx?

Scheduling in Alteryx is managed through Alteryx Server or Alteryx Designer with Scheduler (if licensed). Here’s a breakdown:
	•	Alteryx Designer + Scheduler (for local scheduling):
You can schedule workflows on your local machine using Windows Task Scheduler via the Designer’s built-in scheduler.
	•	Alteryx Server (enterprise scheduling):
	•	Workflows are published to Alteryx Gallery, which is a web-based interface for managing, sharing, and scheduling workflows.
	•	You can schedule recurring runs (daily, weekly, etc.), specify dependencies, and monitor job statuses.
	•	Admins can assign permissions, allocate resources, and view schedules for auditing and compliance.
	•	Alteryx Server supports job queuing and load balancing for scalable scheduling.

✅ Note: Scheduling settings include parameters such as time zones, frequency, notifications on completion or failure, and credentials for database access.

2) We have multiple prod environments in Prod; do we need different jobs for Alteryx, or can we make it work with variables?

You don’t necessarily need separate jobs for each environment if you implement environment-based parameterization using Alteryx constants or workflow/app interface tools.

Approach:
	•	Use workflow constants or Alteryx interface tools like Drop Down, Text Box, or File Browse to allow dynamic input of environment-specific parameters (like file paths, DB credentials, API keys).
	•	Use environment variables or analytic app configuration where users select the environment (Dev, QA, Prod) at runtime.
	•	Incorporate Alteryx Server Environment Variables or use external config files (YAML/JSON) for connection strings and credentials.

✅ Best Practice: One job with parameterization is easier to manage and reduces code duplication.

3) Does deploying Alteryx workflows require a change request?

Yes, in enterprise settings, deploying Alteryx workflows (especially to production environments) generally requires a Change Request (CR) or follows a Change Management Process.
	•	This ensures:
	•	Auditability
	•	Compliance with ITIL or internal governance
	•	Prevention of unauthorized changes
	•	Impact assessment and rollback plans

✅ Typical Process: Dev → QA/Test → UAT → Prod
CR is raised during the UAT to Prod promotion.

4) Does making changes to Alteryx deployed workflows require a change request?

Yes, any change to a deployed workflow (logic change, data source change, parameter change) requires a Change Request if the workflow runs in a production or controlled environment.

This is especially true if the workflow:
	•	Affects downstream systems
	•	Processes critical business data
	•	Is scheduled or shared on the Alteryx Server

✅ Even minor updates often require a CR due to audit/tracking and validation needs.

⸻

5) Does making changes to scheduled jobs require a change request?

Yes, modifying a scheduled job (e.g., altering run frequency, runtime, parameters, or assigned credentials) typically requires a CR in enterprise systems.

Why?
	•	Scheduling affects processing windows, dependencies, and may create load on DBs or APIs.
	•	It can impact SLAs, deliverables, and compliance policies.

✅ Suggested Practice: Maintain versioning of schedule changes and document rationale via CR.

6) If the jobs fail, which support team helps us fix the issue?

This depends on the organization’s support structure, but typically involves:
	•	Tier 1 or L1 Support (Operations or Monitoring Team):
	•	Monitors workflow status
	•	Logs basic errors or alerts
	•	Notifies stakeholders
	•	Tier 2 or L2 Support (Alteryx Administrators / Data Engineers):
	•	Access to Alteryx Gallery or Designer logs
	•	Able to re-run or debug workflows
	•	Responsible for fixing credential issues, data source connectivity, etc.
	•	Tier 3 (Development Team or Data Analytics Team):
	•	Fixes logic or data-level issues within workflows
	•	Handles script-based errors or Python/R tool failures
	•	May work closely with source system admins or DBAs

✅ Tip: The Alteryx Service logs, Gallery logs, and workflow result logs are key for debugging.

7) What’s the process to get license and Alteryx installed on our systems?

Installation & Licensing Process:
	1.	Request Initiation:
	•	End user or team raises a request via the internal IT ticketing system (like ServiceNow or Jira).
	•	Approval may be needed from the manager or project owner.
	2.	License Procurement:
	•	IT or Procurement coordinates with Alteryx sales or license admin to issue Designer/Server licenses.
	•	License keys are tied to the user email or machine.
	3.	Installation:
	•	IT team downloads the installer (from Alteryx’s official site).
	•	Installation is performed with admin rights (if restricted environment).
	•	The user enters the license key or connects to the license server (if using enterprise floating license).
	4.	Activation:
	•	Either automatic (online) or offline activation using license file.
	5.	Validation & Testing:
	•	Ensure connectivity to databases, filesystems, or Alteryx Server.
	•	Test basic workflow creation and execution.

✅ Admins also handle license reassignment, renewals, and usage tracking via Alteryx License Manager or system inventory tools.
